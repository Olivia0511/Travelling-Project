Project Objective
- The objective is to find the most efficient route for a politician to travel to every state capital once, starting in Iowa, and ending in Washington, DC.  

Solution Approach
1. import the math function
   - using equation to calculate the distance between different cities
   - x for latitude and y for longitude
2. Find optimal approach
   - using while loop to find all the combination of cities
   - using while loop to find the distance between different combination of cities
   - find the minimum distance
   - find the optimal approach
3. Input cities coordinates
4. print the answer
